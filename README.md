# Modular Armor
A mod created for GregTech:Î© (a private modpack for now). The intention is to make a
modular armor that can be useful in every stage of the game.

# **This mod is unfinished and unpolished!**
Take any code written here as temporary and try to make sure not to rely on the
internal workings too much. Obviously some stuff will have to, but maybe discuss
the best way with others before hand.

Make sure to do all your work on separete branches and such, I don't have
much experience so I won't lay down the law here, but try to keep it organized
and all that.
